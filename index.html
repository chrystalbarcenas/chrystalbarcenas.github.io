      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p class="p-coloralt">Hello! Im Chrytal! I am 26 years old and a graphic design major at California State University Fullerton with a minor in Computer Science. I am very into expresing myself through art. I chose graphic design as my major because I have always
        been interested in how art can capture your eye and say a message. I am inspired by the world around me. I am also minorning in Computer Science because graphic designeres work side by side with web developers. In my graphic design courses,
        it was important for us to learn some basic html and css so that we could understand what we are asking from when we work with a web developer. This sparked my interest in computere scinece, and inspired me to learn more about web developing
        myself.</p>
