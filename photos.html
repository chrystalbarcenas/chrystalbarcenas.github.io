    <h2>Graduation Photo</h2>

    <img src="images/two.JPG" alt="Graduation Photo" width="500">
    <p>This is one of my graduation photos. It was taken last minute with a friend of mine. I enjoy this photo because it was taken unformally by a good friend of mine who I felt very comfortable around. Since I didnt get to walk like the rest of my
      Spring and Summer 2020 class, it was nice because people who passed by congradulated me from a distance.</p>
