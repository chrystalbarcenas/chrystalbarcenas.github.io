      <h2>Web Developing Experience</h2>
      <p class="p-coloralt">During my graphic design courses at California State University Fullerton, we where taught some basics of html and css. Some of our sprojects where to design what some apps and website would look like, then at the end of the semester we had
        to
        make and design a simple website using html and css. The purpose was to give us an understanding in case we are to work side by side with web developers we would understand what we are a sking and how there can be limitations to our designs

      <h2>What Im Hoping to Learn. </h2>
      <p>I am hoping to learn the process and what goes on when building a website. Since I am a graphic design major with a computer science minor, I am hoping this will teach me how to utilize my skills on both ends. Being a graphic designer, I
        have designed templates for websites, but I had trouble grasping what goes on to make these templates a reality. I am hoping to learn to code websites on my own so that when i design website templates I will better understand what can be
        done, that way I can become multifaceted by being able to design and create websites. </p>
